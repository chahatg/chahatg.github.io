	<!--      Assignment 2: First Webpage  - Index page
	Name: Chahat Gupta, UMass Lowell Computer Science Department
	Email: chahat_gupta@student.uml.edu
	Date: 9/12/18
	This is a webpage, with information about myself and is going to be the index page for all my future assignments. I have used various tags that i learned throughout the lectures (like <p>, <br>, <h1>, etc.) and even made use of some very BASIC INLINE CSS STYLING for my header section.

	I refered to lecture slides and the 1 hour Crash Course video - https://youtu.be/UB1O30fR-EE.

	W3C Markup Validation Service (http://validator.w3.org/) was used for validation! -->

<!-- Here I have made use for some in-line css styling for to add some color and style, and specify alignment -->
<!-- #mainHeader block lets me specify the formatting for my header section, I wanted everything in header to be center aligned and have a nice soothing background. -->


<!-- i aligned the about me heading to the center as well because it just flowed better visually-->
