	This is a webpage, with information about myself and is going to be the index page for all my future assignments. I have used various tags that i learned throughout the lectures (like <p>, <br>, <h1>, etc.) and even made use of some very BASIC INLINE CSS STYLING for my header section.

	I refered to lecture slides and the 1 hour Crash Course video - https://youtu.be/UB1O30fR-EE.
